<p><strong>comprehension</strong> aims to be a terse, expressive Scala plotting DSL for (at the moment) <code>d3.js</code>, which will allow you to quickly generate visualizations and easily improve the interesting ones so that they can be used in presentations and products. Additionally, it avoids introducing library-specific concepts in favor of staying close to idiomatic base Scala.</p>

<p>As a language, Scala offers many features which make it possible to have a really nice plotting solution, but so far, none exist. These features include:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Implicits</strong>, which are idiomatically used for injecting configuration and context while keeping functions brief and uncluttered,</li>
<li>
<strong>Extremely flexible syntax</strong>, which allows for easy specification of DSLs, and, of course,</li>
<li>
<strong>Support for both OOP and FP</strong>, which means that we can use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)">M word</a> and still be taken seriously.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, <a href="http://d3js.org/">d3js</a> is a primary influence; I haven't been using it for long, but I love its flexibility and its idioms, like <code>joins</code>, <code>scales</code>, <code>transitions</code>, and the like.</p>

<p><a href="http://stanford.edu/%7Emwaskom/software/seaborn/">Seaborn</a> because of its sensible deafults and ease of use for statistical data visualization.</p>

<p>The very interesting and very early <a href="http://ioam.github.io/holoviews/">holoviews</a> was the first instance I saw of a library that treated plotting objects as first-class and encouraged composition to build up complex visualizations.</p>

<p>A spiritually similar solution exists in <a href="https://github.com/quantifind/wisp">WISP</a>, but my problems with WISP are that it uses Highcharts, which is not extremely flexible and also not free for enterprise, and that I don't like the workflow it uses, which is too stateful (it's more like <code>matplotlib</code>, in which successive commands will modify the "current" plot if no object is passed in). </p>

<p><code>spark-notebook</code> implements some JS bindings, but those are kind of ugly, and <code>zeppelin</code> has some nice auto-plotting done for you a l√† Databricks, but it's difficult to get those plots out of notebooks and tweak them.</p>
